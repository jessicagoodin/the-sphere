# the-sphere
Web app for event planning and booking.

Value provided: Event planning can be time-consuming, confusing, and can leave a lot of room for errors or missed details. The Sphere app is specifically designed for 
those folks who are most likely planning personal events: women in their 20s and 30s. These women need to plan an event but aren't professional coordinators. 
The app will provide one all-encompassing place for searching, coordinating, and booking so that they can focus on enjoying their event more than planning it.

The typical user: A woman in her 20s to 30s trying to coordinate multiple elements of an event but not having the professional experience, time, or knowledge to do so.

Core feature(s): The Sphere provides the "one-stop shop" for event planning by offering venue selection, event calendar synchronization, booking forms, 
budget tracking and task lists. 

Expansion opportunities include: An invite customizing platform with design tools that allows for selection/upload of logos, photos, and fonts, and provides premade templates.
Collaboration with other event members/planners in real time via chat/messaging and idea sharing in one shared hub.

To begin with, the app will be front-end only (beginning with HTML, CSS, and Javascript).
